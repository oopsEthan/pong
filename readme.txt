goals - 
- Encapsulate everything, need classes for:
  - Both paddles, one controlled by player, other just goes up and down
  - Line down the middle, possibly unnecessary but should be easy to just draw
  - Score at top, big numbers
  - Ball, bounces on bottom or top of screen and off paddle
  - Game runs in main, probably a class just for "screen set up"

ideas -
- Paddles and wall have "solid" variable as True, ball checks for solid to determine if it bounces or not
